## Overview

This Frontend Mentor challenge focuses on HTML and CSS skills. It’s a blog preview card design, which is quite common on blog websites.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- Figma tools

Compared to the previous project, "QR Code Component," this time I incorporated the Figma file into my entire workflow. It’s much more efficient to apply margins and padding directly.

- Cursor syle

It’s my first time customizing the cursor style on hover, and it’s exciting to see how many styles there are to choose from!

```css
.content-main:hover {
    color: #F4D04E;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I've always dreamed of developing a blog or a dating app for the LGBTQ+ community. This project has taught me a lot, and I hope to one day create something as polished and functional as this website!

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools - CSS cursor Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.php) - This isn’t the exact website I referenced to learn about cursor properties (since English isn’t my first language), but it’s still helpful for anyone looking to learn more about cursor styles.
- [Apple - capture mouse pointer in screenshot](https://support.apple.com/zh-tw/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) - It’s a minor issue, but it had me puzzled for a few minutes: for Mac users who never capture the mouse pointer in screenshots...
